            <p>I had owned multiple vacuums from different brands, some of them very expensive and this one is just amazing! Super powerful suction is incredible, I love the odor neutralizer technology. the ord is long enough to vacuum around the house, I love that I can choose from hard floor to low or high carpet, perfect for any type of floor! This vacuum grabs anything, especially my dog hair...</p>

            <p>I have a Shark Navigator, gifted to me by my mother as a house warming gift. I've loved it for years but I was getting tired of giving my vacuum a "haircut" because of the bristles and I started to notice it wasnâ€™t sucking up all the fine granules from my carpet powder, leaving a gritty feeling.</p>

            <p>I love my new Shark Stratos Upright Vacuum. The color is a fun purple/plum color. I like that it has an odor control setting that I can adjust for how much odor controlling aroma I want released. The vacuum was so easy to put together and instructions were easy to read. I like how it lifts away for a handheld vacuum or you can just pull the handle for a wand and add attachment for getting in the corners...</p>
